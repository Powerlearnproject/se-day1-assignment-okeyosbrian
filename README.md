List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the development of high-quality software. It begins with;
1. Planning phase: This is where the project’s objectives, feasibility, risks, resources, and timelines are assessed to create a clear roadmap.
2. The requirements analysis phase; during this phase, stakeholders define and document both functional and non-functional requirements. This phase ensures that the development team fully understands what the software needs to achieve.
3. Design phase: This is where system architecture, database structures, and user interface designs are created. High-level design focuses on the overall system structure, while low-level design details individual components and modules.
4. Implementation (coding) phase: Developers write and integrate code based on the specifications. They use programming languages, frameworks, and development tools to build the software systematically.
5. Testing phase: Where it is checked for bugs, errors, and performance issues. Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT), are conducted to ensure the software meets the required standards and functions as intended.
6. Deployment phase: where it is installed and made available for users, either through a phased rollout, continuous deployment, or a full release.
7. Maintenance and support phase; which involves monitoring the software, fixing any post-launch bugs, implementing updates, and making necessary improvements based on user feedback. This phase ensures that the software remains efficient, secure, and relevant over time. The SDLC provides a systematic approach to software development, reducing risks, improving efficiency, and ensuring the delivery of reliable and high-quality software products. Different methodologies, such as Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps, apply the SDLC in various ways to suit different project needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Approach
Waterfall: Follows a linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile: Uses an iterative, flexible approach with continuous feedback and improvements.
2. Flexibility
Waterfall: Rigid; changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed.
Agile: Highly adaptable; changes can be incorporated at any stage.
3. Development Process
Waterfall: Development is divided into distinct phases (planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance).
Agile: Development is broken into small cycles called sprints, delivering working software incrementally.
4. Documentation
Waterfall: Heavy documentation is required before development begins.
Agile: Less documentation; focuses on working software over detailed documentation.
5. Client Involvement
Waterfall: Limited client involvement after the initial requirements phase.
Agile: Continuous client feedback and collaboration throughout the project.
6. Testing
Waterfall: Testing is done only after the development phase is completed.
Agile: Testing is integrated into each sprint, allowing for early detection of issues.
7. Project Size and Scope
Waterfall: Best for large, well-defined projects with clear requirements.
Agile: Best for projects with evolving requirements and a need for rapid delivery.
